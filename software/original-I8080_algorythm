START:
1 set stack pointer
2 Set the number of repeats N of the full LOOP cycle to 16
(if for 16 repetitions NLOOP EPROM did not ready, we consider the ROM to be faulty)

NLOOP:
3 set the channel modes of the PPA chip
4 output the value 0x60 to channel C (0110 0000):
a) Apply 0 to D4.2 (LED off)
b) Submit 1 to D4.1 (0 to CS)
c) Submit 1 to D3.2 (0 to PR)
d) Apply 0 to D3.1 (1 per key + 24V)

5 Load the upper buffer address of the ROM +1 = 0xF400 (F300-F3FF) into the register pair HL
6 Load the value 1024 (0x0400) into the register pair DE

CHECKEPROM:
7 HL <- HL - 1 (set the highest buffer address)
8 DE <- DE - 1 (Set the highest address bus of the ROM address)
9 Set the address on the ROM address bus, while maintaining the values ​​of the CS and PR bits
10 Read the data byte at this address.
11 Compare the byte received from the ROM with the same target byte of the dump from the buffer
12 Set the value of the RESULT flag to 0x81 (1000 0001) - a sign of failed programming
13 If not 0, go to the PROGRAMM procedure

14 Enter the value D in the battery
15 Check A | E (check if the ROM address is reached zero)
16 If not 0 go to CHECKEPROM:
17 Set N = 1
18 Set the value of the RESULT flag to 0x0F (sign of successful programming)


PROGRAMM:
19 Save program status word
20 Load the value 0x0C (12) into register C
21 Load 0xA0 into the battery
22 Display the value of the battery in port C:
0xA0 = 1010 0000:
a) Apply 1 to D4.2 (light up the LED)
b) Submit 0 to D4.1 (1 to CS (+ 12V))
c) Submit 1 to D3.2 (0 to PR)
d) Apply 0 to D3.1 (1 per key + 24V)

23 Set the channel modes of the PPA chip

LOOP:
24 Download in the register pair HL the upper address of the ROM buffer +1 = 0xF400 (F300-F3FF)
25 Load the value 1024 (0x0400) into the register pair DE

BODYLOOP:
26 HL <- HL - 1 (set the highest buffer address)
27 DE <- DE - 1 (Set the highest address bus of the ROM address)
28 Set the maximum possible address on the ROM address bus, while maintaining the values ​​of the control signals
29 Load the value of the current byte of the ROM buffer into the battery
30 Output it to the data bus
31 Set the control signals to 0x90 (1001 0000):
a) Apply 1 to D4.2 (light up the LED)
b) Submit 0 to D4.1 (1 to CS (+ 12V))
c) Submit 0 to D3.2 (1 to PR)
d) Apply 1 to D3.1 (0 to key + 24V)

## Delay providing programming pulse duration
32 Enter value 16 into the battery
WAIT1:
33 A <- A-1
34 If not 0, go to WAIT1:

35 set the control signals to 0xA0:
0xA0 = 1010 0000:
a) Apply 1 to D4.2 (light up the LED)
b) Submit 0 to D4.1 (1 to CS (+ 12V))
c) Submit 1 to D3.2 (0 to PR)
d) Apply 0 to D3.1 (1 per key + 24V)

36 If the value of the address bus is not 0 (not all the address legs of the ROM have been tried) - go to BODYLOOP
37 Decrease C (LOOP repeat counter)
38 If not 0 go to LOOP
39 restore program status word

40 Decrease N
41 If not 0 go to NLOOP
42 Display the value of the RESULT flag - programming result (success / failure)
43 STOP
